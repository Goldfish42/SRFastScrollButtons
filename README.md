# SRFastScrollButtons

Adds new scroll buttons for 10x faster song scrolling in Synth Riders [PCVR]

The middle arrow buttons also scroll instantly one page at a time, so the scroll animation no longer glitches out if you spam those buttons.

*Note the original Top/Bottom buttons now have an additional arrow/echelon to indicate that they scroll the farthest.

Scrolling with the controller maintains its original behavior, playing a glitch-prone scroll animation as it moves one page at a time.

## Setup
1. Install MelonLoader if you don't already have it:  https://wiki.synthriderz.com/en/guides/installing-mods
2. Grab the newest version of SRFastScrollButtons from releases and extract it to your game directory under .../SynthRiders/Mods (create Mods directory if necessary)
3. [Jam out with Strong Bad!](https://homestarrunner.com/assets/sbemails/sounds/scrollsong3_10.mp3)

## Known Issues
* Cosmetic: If you use the controller thumbstick to scroll songs, I recommend not using any of the scroll buttons while the song list is still moving.  This causes the song list to glitch out, though it's easily fixed if you fiddle with the buttons and/or thumbstick in some order.  I'd be surprised if you haven't already encountered this during your gameplay at some point.  I believe this is a native bug; not caused by this mod.  I do not plan to address it, but if you stick to using the scroll buttons only, it should never happen anymore.
* Cosmetic: At the very top or bottom of the song list, the appropriate buttons do not all become disabled.  I do not plan to address this since it would be a large effort for such a small aesthetic issue.

## Future Plans
* I have completed all intended features and fixed all interesting issues as of Synth Riders v2.3.25.a2.
* I do intend to maintain this mod in case future game updates break it.  However, I make no promises on that or how long it may take.
