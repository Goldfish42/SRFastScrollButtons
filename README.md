# SRFastScrollButtons

Adds new scroll buttons for faster song navigation in Synth Riders [PCVR]

![preview](preview.png)

*Note the original Top/Bottom buttons now have an additional arrow/echelon to indicate that they scroll the farthest

## Setup
!After an update you might have to either grab the newest release of SRFastScrollButtons or reinstall MelonLoader completely!

0. Backup your game files (most important files are songs and settings)
1. Prepare Synth Riders for the use with mods by following the installation instructions for MelonLoader:  https://wiki.synthriderz.com/en/guides/installing-mods
2. Grab the newest version of SRFastScrollButtons from releases and extract it to ./SynthRiders/Mods (create new directory if necessary)
3. [Jam out with Strong Bad!](https://homestarrunner.com/assets/sbemails/sounds/scrollsong3_10.mp3)

## Known Issues
* Cosmetic: Highlighting either of the new buttons will highlight the buttons I copied them from.
* Cosmetic: When at the very top or bottom of the song list, the 3rd arrow/echelon in the Top/Bottom buttons will not dim like the others, nor will the new buttons.

## Disclaimer
This mod is not related to Synth Riders Devs or Kluge Interactive or The Brothers Chaps.
