# SRFastScrollButtons

Adds new scroll buttons for faster song navigation in Synth Riders [PCVR]

![preview](preview.png)

*Note the original Top/Bottom buttons now have an additional arrow/echelon to indicate that they scroll the farthest

## Setup
1. Install MelonLoader if you don't already have it:  https://wiki.synthriderz.com/en/guides/installing-mods
2. Grab the newest version of SRFastScrollButtons from releases and extract it to your game directory under .../SynthRiders/Mods (create Mods directory if necessary)
3. [Jam out with Strong Bad!](https://homestarrunner.com/assets/sbemails/sounds/scrollsong3_10.mp3)

## Known Issues
* Cosmetic: Hovering over either of the new buttons will highlight the buttons I copied them from.
* Cosmetic: When at the very top or bottom of the song list, the 3rd arrow/echelon in the Top/Bottom buttons will not dim like the others, nor will the new buttons.

## Disclaimer
This mod is not related to Synth Riders Devs or Kluge Interactive or The Brothers Chaps.
